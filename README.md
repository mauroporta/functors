Based on the table located at [stacky.net](http://stacky.net/wiki/index.php?title=Math_193a:_Algebraic_Stacks,_Fall_2011#Resources) based on Table 1 from Bjorn Poonen's [Rational points on varieties](http://math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/Qpoints.pdf) I had the idea of doing something analogous for the functors which are associated to a morphism of schemes (or where applicable ringed spaces).

This would serve as a good way to

* solidify my knowledge about this subject
* learn more about all the associated functors I only vaguely know the existence or properties of
* do something awesome based the Stacks project (I hope to inspire others by this)

List of functors
----------------

* direct image
* inverse image (various incarnations, get terminology straight)
* higher direct images
* sections with support [Har, Ex. II.1.20]
* direct image with compact support
* ...


Properties to describe
----------------------

* exactness
* adjointness
* natural interpreations (which categories etc.)
* preservation of (quasi-)coherent sheaves, locally free sheaves, ...
* ...

Format
------

* HTML

  - good styling
  - dynamic view (think toggles: see Remarks)
  - ...

* TeX

  - both a A4 printable and poster version
  - ...

* having both would require some metaformat I'm afraid, or some Python magic to process things

Remarks
-------

* refer to Stacks project and EGA wherever possible, also Hartshorne, Liu (but make the visibility of these, or all references, optional?)
* also provide counterexamples where applicable (again refer to Stacks project, possibly adding them?)
* find a good location for this (GitHub hosting might serve as an option?)
* find people to work together on this (Mauro has agreed, maybe more?)
